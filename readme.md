# Terraform Multi-Environment Setup

This project shows how to manage different environments like **dev**, **staging**, and **prod** using the same Terraform code with environment-specific configurations.

---

##  What is This?

We use:
- Common **Terraform modules**
- Separate **folders** for each environment
- Different **variables** and **state files** per environment
